My name is Egon Gruenter. I am a security professional and for the last 25
years I worked as a security engineer at [Juelich Supercomputing Center
(JSC)](https://www.fz-juelich.de/de/ias/jsc). A list of my publications can be
found [here](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc/publication-lists/gruenter_e).

I live in [Rurich](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rurich) and one of the things
I really love about the  village is the language, called "Ruricher Platt".
